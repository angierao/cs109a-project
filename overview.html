    <h1 >The Nutritional Peril:</h1>

      <p class="lead">Every year, millions of individuals suffer from non-communicable diseases. Non-communicable disease are not contagious, rather they develop through your lifestyle choices including dietary intake. There has been past contradictory research on nutrition. According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/upshot/were-so-confused-the-problems-with-food-and-exercise-studies.html"> New York Times</a>, the same ingredient could be interpreted as starving away cancer or aiding its onset, depending on who you ask. Only two facts are known: holding all exogenous variables constant, consuming more calories will cause weight gain while exercising will produce weight loss. For this project, we chose to apply a data science approach to the former, nutrition, to ask if with enough information, can we can identify trends between food consumption and disease onset rates?  </p>

      <p>Food Data stems from FAOSTAT, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. There are <a href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CC">74 crop predictors</a> and <a href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CL">27 livestock predictors</a>. Disease data was obtained from the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A859?lang=en">WHO</a>, World Health Organization. We tested three non-communicable diseases: cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. </p>

      <p>Data exploration was first performed on the dataset to understand general trends between the predictors and disease mortality rates. The predictors were sorted by r squared values to find the most informative data points.

      <p>One of the most significant difficulties was cleaning the data for analysis. Almost 25% of the values were missing as shown in the below visualization. Extensive code was written to populate missing values with a regional average. For example, missing values for Cuba were filled with the average of all Central America countries. </p>

      <p>The predicted disease mortality rates from our model were then visualized in a world map format to examine for geographic trends. The above graph shows estimated disease mortality per 100,000 individuals while the below map shows the deviation between the predicted and actual mortality rates. A dark blue-purple indicate a more accurate estimate, brighter purples/pinks indicate an overestimate, and brighter blues indicate an underestimate. Since most of the countries are colored with dark shades, this confirms the validity of our our model. </p>

      <p>The goal of this project was to better understand the impact certain food predictors have. While we understand that health is a hollistic outcome dependent on many variables in addition to diet, the consumption of certain food groups appears to be more strongly correlated than others. In particular, starches including potatoes, rice, and wheat should be limited as they are positively linked with cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease incidence rates across the world. The goal of this project was to be informative and utilize a machine learning approach to understanding global health. </p>
