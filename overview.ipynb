    "      <p class=\"lead\">Every year, millions of individuals suffer from non-communicable diseases. Non-communicable disease are not contagious, rather they develop through your lifestyle choices including dietary intake. There has been past contradictory research on nutrition. According to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/upshot/were-so-confused-the-problems-with-food-and-exercise-studies.html\"> New York Times</a>, the same ingredient could be interpreted as starving away cancer or aiding its onset, depending on who you ask. Only two facts are known: holding all exogenous variables constant, consuming more calories will cause weight gain while exercising will produce weight loss. For this project, we chose to apply a data science approach to the former, nutrition, to ask if with enough information, can we can identify trends between food consumption and disease onset rates?  </p>\n",

While we understand that health is a hollistic outcome dependent on many variables in addition to diet, the consumption of certain food groups appears to be more strongly correlated than others. In particular, starches including potatoes, rice, and wheat should be limited as they are positively linked with cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease incidence rates across the world. The goal of this project was to be informative and utilize a machine learning approach to understanding global health. </p>\n",
